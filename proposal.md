# project Description
For my project I want to try and replicate my favorite mobile game "Block Blast!" using javascript p5js.
In this game the objective is so reach the highest score possible by filling up rows and columns in a grid with random block shapes given to user my the code.

## Needs to Have
- different preset shapes of blocks that come in as random
- be able to place the block in the grid and move it around while the mouse is still pressed (drag and drop)
- once a row is full, the blocks should light up dissolve
- filling up  row should increase the score
- once there are no spaces left to place the blocks at the bottom, it should say there are no spaces left

## Nice to Have
- the sound effects in the actual game
- when you clear multiple rows subsequently, it should multiply your score and give you a "combo"
- if the entire grid is clear it should give an extra amount of points 
- have a high score and save it in between games
